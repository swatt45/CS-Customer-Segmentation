# Finding Donors for CharityML

Assessment project for WGU-CS C753 - Machine Learning

# Forked from udacity/DSND_Term1

## Changes to this fork from the original repo

The `p1_charityml.orig` folder is an exact copy of from the `projects\p1_charityml` folder of the original repository.

All files and folders other than `p1_charityml` and `README.md` were deleted (they weren't relevant to the project)

All other files are my original work, unless otherwise noted within the file or a readme in the containing folder.

## finding_donors

The `finding_donors` folder is intended as a submission for grading (the name is required for the submission). It is originally a copy of `p1_charityml.orig`.

See the README.md file in the finding_donors folder for additional details, and submission guidelines.
