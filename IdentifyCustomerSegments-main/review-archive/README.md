This is my archive of the html version of each submission, along with reviewer feedback.
Reviewer feedback has 2 parts per feedback:
1. A pdf "screenshot" of the review page taken with a chrome extension: 
   "GoFullPage - Full page screen capture"
2. A Markdown file with links to resources from those files.
